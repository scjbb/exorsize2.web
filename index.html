        <h2>How Does AI Affect Web Design?</h2>


        <!-- PFormat is an auto fomat for: colour and indent. -->

        <div class="PFormat">
            <p> The ever changing and ever improving use of AI within to the world of graphic design is
                something that
                has been highly debated within the last few years. Some graphic designers are concerned about losing
                potential customers and job opportunities taken by AI and sites that use AI to generate templates and
                art for customers, while others embrace the use of AI as another tool to be used within their roster.
                Within this section, we will be going over how AI effects the world of web design by looking at how AI
                effects the experience and relationship between the web designer and the customer.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="PFormat">
            <p>To under understand more about the effects of AI, first we have to define the different
                ways a professional website can be created and obtained as a customer looking to own a website. As a web
                designer, many of our customers consist of small business owners and large corporate companies. The most
                common way to obtain a website as a customer is typically to go through the process of commissioning a
                graphic designer to create a website, although with the introduction of website building sites, this
                method of obtaining a website is slowly becoming less common. Website building sites typically use a
                combination of premade templates, AI, and auto formatted layouts created by the owner of the website
                building company. It is worth noting that the use of AI within these website building sites vary from
                company to company, with some making completely AI generated sites that only require basic information
                input, while others mostly use AI to format the code that runs the website. The main issue customers
                come across with website builders is the lack of control, variation, and complexity within the final
                product. These issues can all be negated by commissioning a graphic designer, although the price
                difference between the two options often leaves most small business owners settling for the flaws that
                come with website builders.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="PFormat">
            <p>The increasing popularity of website builders are leaving web designers concerned about
                the loss of customers, which is partially why the debate about AI has been coming up more often. To
                create a website from scratch requires a large amount of coding, graphic design knowledge,
                troubleshooting,
                formatting, and time, which is why the cost of commissioning a website from scratch is priced higher
                than the
                cost of website builders. To combat this, some designers began using AI as a tool to help lessen the
                workload
                required to create a website. Extensions like Github can help format text faster by finishing coding
                commands, detect typing errors, organize code automatically, and make suggestions, although sometimes
                these extensions can become bothersome and or harmful. When it comes to creating a website with the use
                of AI, knowing the basics of creating a website is essential. A beginner designer may use coding to help
                speed up the process and check for formatting errors, though relying too heavily on AI can lead to
                errors, buggy features, and in some cases, outright plagiarizing another artist’s work. It is worth
                noting that the possibility of accidentally plagiarizing while creating a website using AI can be mostly
                negated if the extension that uses the AI is trustable and the designer is mindful about what the AI is
                generating. With everything considered, the impact of AI on web design is undeniable, however it is
                up to everyone individually to weigh the pros and cons to make their opinion on it. My opinion on AI?

            <h2>Content Visibility Within CSS</h2>


            <div class="PFormat">
                <p>When creating anything meant to be viewed and used professionally by other people, considering the
                    rendering speed of any given piece of media is mandatory. During around 2020, the content visibility
                    option was added to CSS and made to be compatible with most browsers. This feature was long overdue
                    considering what it helps web designers to do.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="PFormat">
                <p>Content visibility helps web designers to essentially control the strength it takes to rub a website
                    on
                    a device by controlling what is rendered in at any given time. This update achieves this by adding
                    in
                    simple commands that control rendering which in tern, helps conserve the processing power needed to
                    run
                    the site.</p>

                <p>Although there is much more to this feature, the main commands needed and how they work are listed
                    below. Clicking
                    the image below will bring you to the Website for more information.

            <h2>My Favourite CSS Function</h2>


            <div class="PFormat">
                <p>During this exercise, I got a lot of use out of the “Position” function. My biggest
                    struggle I had was
                    trying to figure out why my layout kept breaking each time I tried to format, so what I ended up
                    doing
                    to combat this was using the Position function with percentages. I know I realistically could have
                    fiddled around more with grid layouts and flex boxes, however in the end I found the position
                    function
                    simplest, since my site page is incredibly primitive. For my reference to how I used the Position
                    code,
                    take a look at this screenshot I took of the css code I created for the AI section.</p>
